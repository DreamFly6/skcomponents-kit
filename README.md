# ‚úçÔ∏è About

This repository contains a collection of various `SpriteKit` nodes and components for intermediate/advanced use cases.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution
- Please note that you have to be very careful if you are going to use the repo in commercial projects - **do not use** graphics assets. The assets were taken from the `Web` and [icons8.com](https://icons8.com). However **I strongly recommend to double check it**.

# üïπ Joystick Node
Joystick node component. Controlls `movement` or/and `orientation` of attached node. Implemented using `POP` design. In order to use you need to conform to `Controllable2D` protocol composition typealias. Or you can conform to either `MovableProtocol` or `OrientationProtocol`. 

## Demo

# ‚õì Rope Node
Rope/Chain node component. Can also be used to simulate bridges, platforms and gameplay elemnts. 

## ToDo
- [ ] Ability to slice the rope into pieces

## Demo

# üí£ Destructible Node
Adds an ability to visualize explosions for `SKSpriteNode`s. The physics shape is recalculated when sprite is re-rendered. The effect is fairly simple, however it can be used for games like `Worms` in order to add more dynamic gameplay when using projectiles and bombs.

## ToDo
- [ ] Proper resizing - right now the texture is reset back to the original size when hit tested
- [ ] Ability to slice the node when it is sliced into more than one pieces
